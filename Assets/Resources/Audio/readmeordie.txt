[ Sonic Adventure WAVs ] - [ By Blaze Hedgehog (Blazehgehg@aol.com) ]

Okay. Here you go. 176 Sonic Adventure WAVs. I got most of the character SFX
for most of the characters (Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Gamma and Big). Although
I didn't get all the Chao SFX. That's simply because there's over 30 Chao SFX,
and that would make this zip even bigger. 

I also included alot of other sounds, like springs, and jumping, and skidding...
some of the animal SFX, and other general "cool" things. 

Oh, and incase your wondering the "nohear" set of WAVs are SFX that aren't heard
in the game, yet they're in the soundtest. Also there are others that aren't
marked with "nohear" but aren't heard in the game. An example is "uhwhat.wav"
and tiptoe1 and tiptoe2. I also named 2 of them by where they are in the
soundtest, 13-4-2 and 13-4-3... they're also not heard in the game. 

Also included is the sound that Kulock of the Moogle Cavern pointed out,
Soundtest 26-1-13, a "Dragon" amidst the Sky Chase SFX (sc_drgn.wav and
drgnflap.wav).

There are alot of SFX here, some heard and some not heard. In any case, they'll
supply you with a ton of cool Sonic Adventure Soundeffects.

All I ask in the end is that you give me (Blaze Hedgehog) credit if you use
them in a fangame, or such.

Enjoy!
